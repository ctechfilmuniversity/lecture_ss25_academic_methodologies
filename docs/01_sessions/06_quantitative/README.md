## Your Paper

### Task 06.01 - Introduction


Write the introduction for your paper. You do not need to re-use this introduction later for your actual paper - but you should! You can re-cap in [Chapter - Academic Writing](../../02_scripts/am_03_writing_script.md#the-introduction) what the introduction is about.

**Do not use a GenAi Tool for this task, as it is about practicing to write.**  
After all learning to write, is learning to think...

*Submission*: Your introduction - no need to use the paper template yet but you can make the submission with a markdown file.
