## Your Paper

### Task 04.01 - Methodology

Deadline: June 5th


It is time to think about how you want to answer the question(s) you are posing.  

Brainstorm which steps you want to apply to get answers to your research question. This task does not aim to find your personal journey of investigation. You should work on defining the approach that you will present in a paper as your methodology (but of course, you can also reflect on what you, personally, need to do to get there). This task does not need to represent formal academic methods for now. It is more about a description of the steps in your own words, structured by the sections of a paper.

Write down your methodology as overall paper structure (sections) and bullet points for each section. 
  
*Submission*: Your paper structure and bullet points for each section.
