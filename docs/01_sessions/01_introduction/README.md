### Task 01.01 - Working With Literature

Have a look at possible tools and setups to organize your collected papers. Chose a setup and reflect on your choice.

*Submission*: Brief description of your setup.


## Your Paper

### Task 01.02 - Topic Brainstorming

Collect a wide range of potential topics and keywords for your paper. 

I recommend brainstorming for 20 minutes and writing down whatever comes to your mind.

*Submission:* Bullet points of your topic ideas.

### Task 01.03 - Topic Selection

From your brainstorming output select three topics that you want to consider for your paper. Further, think about them, e.g. 

* What specifically interests you within that topic? 
* What further characteristics does the topic have? 
* What questions could you ask about that topic? 
* How could you solve those questions? 


For this task, you must submit three topics, even if you have already chosen a topic for your paper. Briefly explain your choices.
  
  

*Submission:* Your selection of topics and the motivation for them.
