### Task 02.01 - Question Selection

<br />

**Deadline: May 12th**

* Describe 1-3 questions that you are considering for your paper and explain for each, why you are interested in that particular question.
* Make an appointment (before May 12th) with Alex or Lena to discuss your ideas. We will help you with finding your question.
  
*Submission:* Your selection of questions, and for each their description and your motivation for them.

## 01 - focus on model

### tripod exercise

**Round I**

1. I am examining the application of supervised learning for predicting semantic coordinates from textual data
2. because I want to find out how effectively a custom-trained model can map textual content to semantically meaningful spatial coordinates
3. in order to determine the advantages and disadvantages such an approach offers over a combination of high-dimensional text embeddings with traditional dimensionality reduction techniques.

**Round II**

The goal of this module paper is to...

- The goal of this module paper is to develop and evaluate a supervised learning approach for predicting semantic spatial coordinates from text, comparing its performance against established dimensionality reduction pipelines.

Research question:

- How does a custom-trained supervised learning model for predicting semantic coordinates from text compare to hybrid approaches using BERT embeddings with UMAP reduction in terms of startup time, inference speed, accuracy, and file size?

Working hypothesis:

- I hypothesize that a supervised learning model trained directly on mapping text to semantic coordinates will demonstrate faster inference times and smaller file sizes than hybrid BERT+UMAP approaches, while maintaining acceptable accuracy in preserving semantic relationships.

## 02 - focus on dataset

### tripod exercise

**Round I**

1. I am examining methods for generating large-scale datasets that map a large range of text to semantically coherent spatial coordinates
2. because I want to understand how different dimensionality reduction techniques create spatial structures that preserve semantic relationships in textual data
3. in order to determine an effective approach for creating training datasets that enable semantic coordinate prediction through supervised learning

**Round II**

The goal of this module paper is to...

- The goal of this module paper is to develop and evaluate a pipeline for generating large-scale datasets that map textual content to semantically meaningful spatial coordinates for training predictive models.

Research question:

- How can dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP be optimally configured to generate training datasets that map encyclopedic texts to semantically coherent spatial coordinates?

Working hypothesis:

- I hypothesize that UMAP-based dimensionality reduction applied to BERT embeddings will produce the most semantically coherent spatial mappings for training a coordinate prediction model, with performance varying significantly based on hyperparameter configurations.
