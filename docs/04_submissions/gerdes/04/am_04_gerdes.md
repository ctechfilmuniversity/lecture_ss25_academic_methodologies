## Your Paper

### Task 04.01 - Methodology

Deadline: June 5th

It is time to think about how you want to answer the question(s) you are posing.

Brainstorm which methods and/or which steps you want to apply. This task does not aim to find your personal journey of investigation. You should work on defining the approach that you will present in a paper as your methodology (but of course, you can also reflect on what you, personally, need to do to get there).

Write down your methodology as overall paper structure (sections) and bullet points for each section.

_Submission_: Your paper structure and bullet points ofr each section.
