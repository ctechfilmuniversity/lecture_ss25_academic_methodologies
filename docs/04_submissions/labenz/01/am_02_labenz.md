## Expanding Agent-based AI Reasoning Methods Beyond Role-Playing

- Many research papers focus on using different techniques to improve AI performance such as Chain of Thought, Tree of Thought, or Graph of Thought, making it challenging to find a niche and provide novel contributions.
- A paper topic could be implementing the [Vroomâ€“Yetton-Jago decision model](https://lead-conduct.de/2023/12/06/vroom-yetton-jago-entscheidungsmodell/) for LLMs. This approach could help LLMs determine whether they can solve a problem independently or need to request additional help/context

## Map Projections for Navigation Apps

- Numerous research studies on map projections from 10-20 years ago exist, yet few have been implemented in today's applications.
- While I haven't found the exact projection I envisioned, I discovered several that attempt to solve similar problems.

## Gesture-to-Easing Conversion for Intuitive Motion Design

**My Favorite:**

- Current motion design tools lack intuitive interfaces for defining easing curves, particularly for beginners who struggle to translate movement concepts into technical parameters.
- This research would explore using hand gestures to naturally create easing curves for animations, similar to how animation directors "conduct" movements.
- Some existing papers have explored related concepts, such as [Magical Hands](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/projects/magical-hands/) for VR animation and [hand gesture authoring for plant motions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313546538_Interactive_authoring_of_bending_and_twisting_motions_of_short_plants_using_hand_gestures_CHEN_AND_JOHAN).
- The innovation would be developing a real-time system that accurately translates physical gestures into production-ready animation curves, bridging the gap between intuitive movement and technical implementation.
