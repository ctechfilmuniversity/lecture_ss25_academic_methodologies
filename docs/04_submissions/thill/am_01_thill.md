# Homework 01:

### Task 01.01 - Working With Literature

I haven’t worked with many research tools before, so this setup is more of a starting point — based on what I think could work well. The only exception is Zotero, which I used a bit during my bachelor thesis. Back then, I just scratched the surface, but this time I want to use it more consistently as my main reference manager.

Alongside Zotero, I’m planning to use Connected Papers, Research Rabbit, and Notion:

- Connected Papers looks great for getting a visual overview of how papers relate to each other. I like the idea of seeing a whole network of work instead of only following citations linearly.

- Research Rabbit seems to offer a more dynamic way to discover new papers, follow specific authors, and explore related research paths — so I want to try it out alongside Connected Papers.

- Zotero will be the place where I store papers, manage citations, and take quick notes. Since I already used it a bit, it feels like a good anchor to build on.

- Notion is where I’d like to gather longer reflections, summaries, and keep an overview of my reading. I already use it regularly, so it makes sense to extend that into my research process.

- I’m also curious to explore Kumu, which allows for visual mapping of ideas and could be useful when dealing with more abstract or cross-disciplinary topics. And I want to try out [Notero](https://github.com/dvanoni/notero), which connects Zotero to Notion and could help streamline the whole workflow.

### Task 01.03 - Topic Selection

### 1. Taste as a battleground in social and cultural adversity

<span style="color: hsl(210, 52.90%, 73.30%); font-weight: bold;">What specifically interests you within that topic?</span>

How taste in music and art becomes a form of resistance in times of adversity, both socially and culturally. I’m interested in scenes like punk, hip-hop, rave culture, and post-dubstep as examples.

<span style="color: hsl(210, 52.90%, 73.30%); font-weight: bold;">What further characteristics does the topic have?</span>

It connects to sociology, subcultures, and how digital platforms today shape or polarise taste.

<span style="color: hsl(210, 52.90%, 73.30%); font-weight: bold;">What questions could you ask about that topic?</span>

How has adversity shaped taste historically?
How do algorithms influence taste today?

<span style="color: hsl(210, 52.90%, 73.30%); font-weight: bold;">How could you solve those questions?</span>

By studying case examples of cultural movements and analysing digital platforms' impact on taste.

### 2. Does the value of creative work inflate with the rise of AI?

<span style="color: hsl(210, 52.90%, 73.30%); font-weight: bold;">What specifically interests you within that topic?</span>

Whether human-made creativity becomes more valuable — emotionally or economically — as AI-generated work becomes widespread.

<span style="color: hsl(210, 52.90%, 73.30%); font-weight: bold;">What further characteristics does the topic have?</span>

It ties to economics, the philosophy of art, and shifts in how authenticity and effort are valued.

<span style="color: hsl(210, 52.90%, 73.30%); font-weight: bold;">What questions could you ask about that topic?</span>

Will scarcity shift from production to authenticity?
Can audiences differentiate AI from human creativity?

<span style="color: hsl(210, 52.90%, 73.30%); font-weight: bold;">How could you solve those questions?</span>

By examining value theory, authenticity studies, and observing emerging artist strategies post-AI.

### 3. The aesthetics of imperfection in a digital age

<span style="color: hsl(210, 52.90%, 73.30%); font-weight: bold;">What specifically interests you within that topic?</span>

Why artists deliberately embrace imperfection — glitches, noise, randomness — in a world where digital perfection is easy.

<span style="color: hsl(210, 52.90%, 73.30%); font-weight: bold;">What further characteristics does the topic have?</span>

It relates to nostalgia, anti-corporate aesthetics, and emotional depth in digital art.

<span style="color: hsl(210, 52.90%, 73.30%); font-weight: bold;">What questions could you ask about that topic?</span>

Why is imperfection emotionally powerful?
Can imperfection be designed intentionally?

<span style="color: hsl(210, 52.90%, 73.30%); font-weight: bold;">How could you solve those questions?</span>

By researching glitch art, lo-fi aesthetics, and studying emotional responses to imperfection.

### 4. Connecting real-time photorealistic animation with music

<span style="color: hsl(210, 52.90%, 73.30%); font-weight: bold;">What specifically interests you within that topic?</span>

I'm interested in how real-time visual technologies (like Unreal Engine) can be synchronised with music to create immersive, emotionally powerful experiences.

<span style="color: hsl(210, 52.90%, 73.30%); font-weight: bold;">What further characteristics does the topic have?</span>

It combines technical challenges (latency, synchronisation) with artistic ones (narrative, mood, atmosphere).

<span style="color: hsl(210, 52.90%, 73.30%); font-weight: bold;">What questions could you ask about that topic?</span>

How can sound and image be linked in real time without losing emotional depth?
What creative opportunities arise from real-time interaction?

<span style="color: hsl(210, 52.90%, 73.30%); font-weight: bold;">How could you solve those questions?</span>

By exploring technical workflows (like MIDI or OSC control) and analysing existing live audiovisual performances or installations.

### Brief explanation of my choice of topics:

I chose these topics because they reflect my ongoing interest in the tension between digital technology, creativity, and human authenticity. They align closely with my personal work and engage with current debates in culture and technology. I also added a fourth topic in Task 01.03, as I realised it covers an area I am deeply interested in and had initially overlooked.
