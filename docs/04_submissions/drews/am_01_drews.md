## **Task 01.01 - Working With Literature**

I will probably be using Zotero to organise the papers and citations that I use. I have not used this tool before but all my classmates have told me that it it is a great way to keep track of everything and make sure that everything you mention is cited properly. I also read that it has a plugin for Google Docs which is great so I can write my paper in Google Docs and then link all my collected pages directly. 

## **Task 01.02 - Topic Brainstorming**

- VR for learning history
- VR for transformation of museums to make it more appealing for younger generations
- AI helping the education systems of developing nations
- Further polarisation of politics due to AI
- The role of AI in psychology
- Data visualisation of wealth inequality of world
- Data visualisation of the 1%

## **Task 01.03 - Topic Selection**

### **1. Using VR for learning history**

- What specifically interests you within that topic?

We are living at a time where the importance of history and the attempt of learning and not repeating the mistakes is more important than ever. For many, learning history can be quite boring and bland with people not truly being able to understand what people went through at a different point of time. Using VR’s immersive ability, I want to research how impactful this tool can be in helping bring some life to historical moments in history. 

- What further characteristics does the topic have?

This topic will also be looking at different narrative techniques within VR and which ones should be employed. Most countries have very dark pasts and, depending on the history and the targeted age groups, making something too immersive could actually traumatise people. It would be interesting to look at the different ways VR goes about narration without affecting people too much. 

- What questions could you ask about that topic?
1. How effective could this be?
2. Which age groups would benefit the most from it? 
3. How should it be told? Within the context of museums or a classroom? 
4. What are the ethical considerations one should take into account

- How could you solve those questions?

I would need to do research in a myriad of different topics. Firstly, I would look into education and how effective current modes of teaching history are. There, I would also be able to look into which age groups could benefit the most. I would then need to look into VR and read discussions on how other people presented potentially traumatising content. This would help me answer the question on which ethical considerations to take into account and if the VR should only be used within the context of a museum or classroom in order for people to have time to process the topic. 

### 2. The role of AI in psychology

- What specifically interests you within that topic?

It is no secret that psychology is unaffordable for most people. Already, people are going to models such as ChatGPT to get advice on certain problems they are having. I would like to look into this topic more and look at the different advances people are making in this field. 

- What further characteristics does the topic have?

It would be interesting to also look into how AI could help therapy sessions with psychologists present. I  recently listened to a podcast from the Guardian which looked a new type of technique in psychology called Avatar Therapy to help people going through psychosis. This is when they create an avatar of the voice in their head and then confront them during their therapy sessions. I think it would be interesting to therefore also look into how AI could further improve these types of therapies and, I am sure, many others like it out there.

- What questions could you ask about that topic?
1. How many people are there in need of psychological help that are not able to access it? 
2. What are the ethical implications of creating a designated chatbot for psychology? Who would be responsible when something bad happens? 
3. Should there be any regulations on who should invest in such a program? 
- How could you solve those questions?

I would firstly need to look firstly into some statistics on the state of psychological help in the world today. I would then need to look into some of the ethical implications of such a tool and for this I will probably try to find sources where people made similar types of projects and what problems arose for them. Lastly, I think it would be interesting to see who would have the ‘power’ in the tool by looking at potential issues that can arise when tools such as this have the wrong investors. 

### 3. AI helping the education systems of developing nations

- What specifically interests you within that topic?

Education is one of the most impactful tools to bring people out of poverty. Unfortunately, majority of the world does not have either access to it or the quality they do have is insufficient. I would like to look into the various way that this could be implemented to further my understanding on both the positive and negative impacts it could have. 

- What further characteristics does the topic have?

I think it would be also interesting to look at the various teaching methods that could easily be made using AI. After learning about the historical simulations that history professor Benjamin made for his classes at UC Santa Cruz in the book I chose for Academic Readings 1, I have been thinking of all the other impactful ways that AI could help teachers give more immersive lessons thus potentially increasing the students participation in a topic.

- What questions could you ask about that topic?
1. What is the current state of education distribution in the world? 
2. What have some of the failures been of previous EdTech projects? 
3. If something were to go wrong with the AI program, who would be to blame? 
- How could you solve those questions?

I would firstly look into the current state of education and try and find some good statistics showing how dire the situation is for many countries. I would then look into the various EdTech programs that have taken place and look at what they did well and what went wrong. Lastly, I would look once again into the question of who is to blame if a program like this was to go wrong due to the importance of the task at hand.
