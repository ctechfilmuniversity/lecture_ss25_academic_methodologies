My paper will be a comparative analysis of the two case studies mentioned in my research question: *Unsupervised* by Refik Anadol and *New Directions May Emerge* which was curated by Joasia Krysa.

Research question:

"Seeing the Archive: How can art museums use AI to visualise their Archives and use it to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within their collections?”

Below is the structure I am thinking of having so far:

1. **Introduction** 
- Explain AI’s growing role in museums
- Introduce research question and why it is important
- Introduce two case studies
- Explain that this will be a comparative analysis between the two case studies

2. **Literature Review**
- Overview how AI technologies are being used in cultural heritage and archives (eg machine learning)

3. **Case study 1 and case study 2. I will separate this into two paragraphs but look at the same things which are:**
- Description
- AI used
- Type of archive visualised
- Insights and patterns revealed
- Visitor experience

4. **Comparative analysis**
- Compare the AI used, data sources, archival materials, visitor approach and what patterns and relationships are revealed

5. **Conclusion** 
- Summarise findings and what museums can learn from using AI in their archives
