My paper will be a comparative analysis of the two case studies mentioned in my research question: *Unsupervised* by Refik Anadol and *New Directions May Emerge* which was curated by Joasia Krysa.

Research question:

"Seeing the Archive: How can art museums use AI to visualise their Archives and use it to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within their collections?”

Below is the structure I am thinking of having so far:

1. **Introduction** 
- Explain AI’s growing role in museums
- Introduce research question and why it is important
- Introduce two case studies
- Explain that this will be a comparative analysis between the two case studies

2. **Literature Review**
- Overview how AI technologies are being used in cultural heritage and archives (eg machine learning)

3. **Case study 1 and case study 2. I will separate this into two paragraphs but look at the same things which are:**
- Description
- AI used
- Type of archive visualised
- Insights and patterns revealed
- Visitor experience

4. **Comparative analysis**
- Compare the AI used, data sources, archival materials, visitor approach and what patterns and relationships are revealed

5. **Conclusion** 
- Summarise findings and what museums can learn from using AI in their archives

Feedback Lena:
* In papers (differently to theses) you focus on your "contributions" in the introduction, not explicitly on the research question. We will talk about this one more time in class at a later point.
* You also need a "Related Work" section, discussing similar studies. If there are only few, you can merge this into the introduction.
* You are always aiming for project-specific section titles. E.g., "AI-based Cultural Heritage Tools" (not a great suggestion - more meant as explanation) instead of "Literature Review".
* 3. needs a title, also think already about sub-section title
* You might want to merge 4. into 3. as that is the actual interesting part about the cases?
* You also want an overall discussion, referring to the paper as a whole, which is currently missing

Feedback Alex:  

Very good, I could follow it all clearly and it makes sense. Some bits that need development:
- The title is ok but I have a problem with the phrase "hidden patterns and relationships". It reappears at multiple points in the outline, but without any further explanation. What kind of patterns and relationships are you interested in? I think it is important to define what this might be at this point, even if it changes later.  
- Section 3 “Insights and patterns revealed” —> again, what insights and patterns are you actually looking for? It is not entirely clear what you hope to get out of the comparison.  
- Section 3 "Visitor experience" -> same question - what are you looking for here? There could be many relevant and less relevant things e.g. enjoyment of the exhibition, engagement, learning, money spent. In addition, how do you plan to get this information for your case studies?  
- “Comparative analysis” —> this needs a little more fleshing out. You again mention patterns and relationships, but it would be helpful to know already what kinds of things you might hope to get out, even if this changes later once the results are in.
