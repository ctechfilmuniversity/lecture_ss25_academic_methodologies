## Task 5: **Qualitative Research and Analysis**

**Research question**

"Seeing the Archive: How can art museums use AI to visualise their Archives and use it to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within their collections?”

**Goal**

My paper will be a comparative analysis of the two case studies mentioned in my research question: *Unsupervised* by Refik Anadol and *New Directions May Emerge* which was curated by Joasia Krysa.

**Task 05.01 - Related Work**

In this paper the author comes up with a checklist which projects that use AI in cultural heritage institutions could complete in order to provide the audience with a clear understanding of the project’s considerations and limitations. I think that this will give me a better understanding on what things to include in my comparison of the two projects that I included and provide my paper with a clear reason as to why.

This paper  will accompany the second case study that I will be analysing in my paper as it explores this project in detail. It also has some other insights and observations in terms of using AI for curation which I would like to include in my introduction.

This paper examines a tool that the authors made called xCurator which is an AI web application that helps visitors curate their own experience through an exhibition. This paper is particularly useful as it explores how AI can actively shape curatorial processes and audience engagement which I think will be good to mention, especially for my second case study.
