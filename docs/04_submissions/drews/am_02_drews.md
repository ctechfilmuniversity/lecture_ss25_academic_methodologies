## **Task 01.01 - Question Selection**

**What are the current state-of-the-art approaches in augmented reality (AR) projects that engage with traumatic or sensitive aspects of national histories, particularly in terms of narrative strategies, user experience design, and their treatment of cultural and ethical significance?**

To answer this question I will find three AR projects from 3 different countries that have AR applications focused on their countries traumatic history and analyse each according to the different narrative styles used, how the user experiences differ and what the cultural significance is for each of them. From this I will create a state of the art report that will help foster a clearer understanding of the current techniques and approaches AR creators are using in this field. 

My contribution to this topic will be the selection of projects and my further analysis where I summarise, categorize and potentially find reoccurring patterns between the projects. At the moment I have only mentioned narrative style, user experience and cultural significance significance as some of the ways I will be analysing each project but this is open to change since I might change them or add to it according to all the further readings I will be doing. 

I have also mentioned that I will be only doing this analysis for AR projects however, I might include VR projects and make this asses interactive media in general. I read a paper that favours AR due to it allowing for a more collaborative experience but, if I find VR projects or readings that change my mind and include VR.

Two readings I am interested in at the moment:

Readings: 

1. *A Review of Augmented Reality Applications for History Education and Heritage Visualisation* by Jennifer Challenor and Minhua Ma

‘The purpose of this study is to speculate regarding the following questions: How is augmented reality currently being used to enhance history education? Does the usage of augmented reality assist in developing long-term memories? Is augmented reality capable of conveying the emotional weight of historical events? Will augmented reality be appropriate for teaching a complex field such as the Holocaust? To address these, multiple studies have been analysed for their research methodologies and how their findings may assist with the development of
Holocaust education.’

2. *Virtual reality and affective learning in commemorative history teaching: effects of immersive technology and generative learning activities* by Miriam Mulders, Kristian H. Träg, Lilly Kaninski, Lara Kirner & Michael Kerres

‘This study examines a highly engaging and historical immersive VR application and thereby investigates the effectiveness of the generative learning activities of self-explaining and drawing. Seventy-four undergraduate students explored a three-dimensional representation of the room where Anne Frank, a Jewish girl, was hiding during World War II.’
