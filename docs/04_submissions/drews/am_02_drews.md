## **Task 01.01 - Question Selection**

**Question 1: What are the best practices for integrating Artificial Intelligence into exhibition and museum experiences?**

AI has already been shaping the way museums run in terms of how they are curated, experienced and understood. In this paper, I will explore best practices for integrating AI into exhibition spaces by analyzing a selection of current case studies as well as relevant academic literature. My aim is to identify what is working, what challenges exist, and how these approaches might help increase interest in museums. 

Museum spaces have seen a decline in attendance in the past few years. The paper I chose for Academic Readings 2 showed this stating that, ‘The UK’s Department for Culture, Media and Sports [17] reported a decline in visitor numbers, at 6.0%, a significant number considering that annual museum visitor population in the previous year was 47.7m.’. Therefore, one of the main issues I will be trying to tackle through my analysis is how to keep people’s interest in museums and that will hopefully be helped by AI. 

Another reason why I want to do this topic is because for my Orientation Project 2, Sophie and I are currently brainstorming how we could make an app or website that helps guide people through the exhibition at Sehsüchte. One of our ideas is to add some AI features into the app, so I would like to look at all the different ways current institutions are going about integrating AI into their apps and see what seems to be working and what not.

Readings: 

1. The Effects of VR Environments on the Acceptance, Experience, and Expectations of Cultural Heritage Learning by Ch’ng, Li, Cai, and Leow (2020)

**Question 2: What are the current state-of-the-art approaches in augmented reality (AR) projects that engage with traumatic or sensitive aspects of national histories, particularly in terms of narrative strategies, user experience design, and their treatment of cultural and ethical significance?**

To answer this question I will find three AR projects from 3 different countries that have AR applications focused on their countries traumatic history and analyse each according to the different narrative styles used, how the user experiences differ and what the cultural significance is for each of them. From this I will create a state of the art report that will help foster a clearer understanding of the current techniques and approaches AR creators are using in this field. 

My contribution to this topic will be the selection of projects and my further analysis where I summarise, categorize and potentially find reoccurring patterns between the projects. At the moment I have only mentioned narrative style, user experience and cultural significance significance as some of the ways I will be analysing each project but this is open to change since I might change them or add to it according to all the further readings I will be doing. 

I have also mentioned that I will be only doing this analysis for AR projects however, I might include VR projects as well. I read a paper that favours AR due to it allowing for a more collaborative experience but if I find VR projects or readings that change my mind I will include VR.

Two readings I am interested in at the moment:

Readings: 

1. *A Review of Augmented Reality Applications for History Education and Heritage Visualisation* by Jennifer Challenor and Minhua Ma

2. *Virtual reality and affective learning in commemorative history teaching: effects of immersive technology and generative learning activities* by Miriam Mulders, Kristian H. Träg, Lilly Kaninski, Lara Kirner & Michael Kerres
