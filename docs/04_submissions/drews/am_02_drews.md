I would like my paper to explore the use of AR/VR technologies for depicting traumatic histories in countries such as the Holocaust or Apartheid South Africa. I am still not sure if I want to solely focus on apartheid in South Africa or rather explore the various narrative styles and artistic methods that would be most appropriate for such sensitive topics and how this type of technology would be beneficial. At the moment I am thinking on focusing on these questions and then using the case of making an application to explore apartheid South Africa as a sort of case study like what was done in the first paper I included below. 

1. **How beneficial would an AR/VR application be for learning about traumatic or sensitive aspects of a country's history and which one is better?**

I am interested in exploring this questions because I think that, when exploring traumatic stories, it’s important to analyse why a tool would be beneficial  in the first place. Due to the artistic nature of an AR/VR application, I think it is important to always keep in mind what the main purpose of such an application is in order to always keep in in mind when making artistic choices.  The two readings I have listed below also support this with the second saying that, ‘Immersive technologies…have the potential to evoke strong emotions, provide high levels of engagement, and include an attractive environment to address affective learning objectives which are often difficult to implement purposefully in everyday educational settings.’ (pg. 17, Reading 2)

2. **What could an AR/VR application bring that other forms of media cannot?** 

I think that this would be an important question to explore since other forms of media are already being used to explore topics like this so its important to look at what this form brings to the table.  I think that AR/VR has a good case for a topic like this since one of the main things that this type of media is able to achieve is empathy and I think that is one of the main objectives of exploring a sensitive parts of history like this. I think that these forms of media can also be more interactive (especially AR) which can also be beneficial since it can lend itself to collaborative learning which has also proven to be beneficial. Lastly, this technology can help explore the grey areas in topics such as this due to how other forms of media tern to simplify history, ‘The challenge of adapting augmented reality for history education was addressed in a study performed by Blanco-Fernández et al. [16] on immersive learning. The authors expressed frustration over the way in which films, video games and comic books have influenced history education by adapting complex military and geopolitical events into a simple good against evil narrative when these events were much greyer in terms of morality.’ pg 4 (reading 1)

3. **What types of narrative styles should be employed to effectively tell this piece of history?** 

The way an application explores this issue is important since certain narrative styles could actually cause harm to both users and the history that it is depicting. I think an interesting observation is found in this reading that explores how, ‘viewers should not be left with the impression that they have experienced or can relate to the suﬀering endured by the victims of the Holocaust.’  pg. 10 (Reading 1). Both of the readings I have listed have not gone into this too much so I will be trying to find other sources to explore this.

Two readings I am interested in at the moment:

Readings: 

1. *A Review of Augmented Reality Applications for History Education and Heritage Visualisation* by Jennifer Challenor and Minhua Ma

‘The purpose of this study is to speculate regarding the following questions: How is augmented reality currently being used to enhance history education? Does the usage of augmented reality assist in developing long-term memories? Is augmented reality capable of conveying the emotional weight of historical events? Will augmented reality be appropriate for teaching a complex field such as the Holocaust? To address these, multiple studies have been analysed for their research methodologies and how their findings may assist with the development of
Holocaust education.’

2. *Virtual reality and affective learning in commemorative history teaching: effects of immersive technology and generative learning activities* by Miriam Mulders, Kristian H. Träg, Lilly Kaninski, Lara Kirner & Michael Kerres

‘This study examines a highly engaging and historical immersive VR application and thereby investigates the effectiveness of the generative learning activities of self-explaining and drawing. Seventy-four undergraduate students explored a three-dimensional representation of the room where Anne Frank, a Jewish girl, was hiding during World War II.’
