## **Task 03.02 - Final Description**

Research Question: 

"Seeing the Archive: How can art museums use AI to visualise their Archives and use it to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within their collections?”

Description:

AI has been rapidly transforming many industries in the past few years - including the cultural sector. This paper will explore how it can be used in art museums and if it could possibly help art curators understand and interpret their collections better. This will be done through the examination of two art museum’s different approaches to visualising their archives. The first work is an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art called *Unsupervised* by Refik Anadol and the other is  *New Directions May Emerge* which was curated by Joasia Krysa and is based on work from Helsinki Art Museum. By comparing these two projects, the paper investigates how AI can help visualise these archives and reveal new patterns, relationships, and narratives within art collections.

I added screenshots of the prompts I used to get to this description. You can see them in the folder 'AI prompts'. I first asked it to improve the first draft of my description (I used some of the changes it suggested in the final version) and then asked it if the two projects I included had been analysed before in order to make sure this question is somewhat novel. The other use-case I had for using ChatGPT was finding research papers that I could use.
