# Your Paper
## Task 02.01 - Question Selection

_**Describe 1-3 questions that you are considering for your paper and explain for each, why you are interested in that particular question.**_

I  chose the topic: _**Non human dramaturgies and narratives.**_

**1. How can the communication of plant species enrich the human dramaturgies in order to create a post-human storytelling?**

I find it fascinating how the plant species have their own communication and the way it does not depend on humans to exist, despite of the anthropocentrism and the idea of the humans "organizing" and "giving use" to beings that were, are and will always have their own order and objectives.

I also feel curious about the ways in which alarm signals or help is provided and how this can interact and influence the human storytelling. 

**2. Could the synesthesia be a dramaturgical and narrative bridge between the human perception and the communication of the plant species?**

I just started reading the book _"Welche Farbe hat  der Montag?"_ by Hinderk Emrich, Udo Schneider and Markus Zedler about the synesthesia and the life with interconnected sins. I think it is very interesting to get closer to other possibilities of the human perception, where everything can be interconnected. Not everyone is "synesthesic", but what if this phenomena could be the bridge between the human and the non human story telling?

**3. How are the dramaturgies and the narratives in nature and how can we integrate them in our human discourse?**

I like this idea of working together with plants to create stories. I would like to evaluate the post-humanistic and eco feminist ideas in the praxis of the storytelling.
