# Task 03.02 - Final Description


**_Describe in max. 1500 characters, what your paper investigates. Be specific, well-defined and narrow. If you have a research question: even better._**

I  chose the topic: _**Non human dramaturgies and narratives.**_


This would be my research question:

**What are the dramaturgical tools that the plant - plant communication of the tropical rainforest can enrich the artistic interaction between plants and humans?**


My paper focuses in the analysis of the communication between plants in the tropical rainforest and its implementation in the creative process of interactive art, where plants and humans can create a symbiotic system. I will look for artists and scientist, who have already identified and created such systems and I will create a framework for the creation of a non-human dramaturgy, that can be used in the context of interactive media. 

My starting point is the paper:  

_"Michelle Chang, Chenyi Shen, Aditi Maheshwari, Andreea Danielescu, and Lining Yao. 2022. Patterns and Opportunities for the Design of Human-Plant Interaction. In Designing Interactive Systems Conference (DIS ’22), June 13–17, 2022, Virtual Event, Australia. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 24 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3532106.3533555"_

Which gives a framework for designing human-plants interaction, based on interdisciplinary approaches. 

I am also taking into account script classics like:

* "Frensham, Raymond. 1996. Scriptwriting. London: Lincolnwood." 
* Kellermann, Ron. 2018. Das Storytelling Handbuch. Sankt Gallen: Midas.

But I also what to learn more about non-linear structures, in order to be aware of the possibilities of the dramaturgy like: 

* Aronson, Linda. 2010. The 21st Century Screenplay. New York: Allen & Unwin.
* McKee, Robert. 2016. Story: Die Prinzipien des Drehbuchschreibens. Berlin: Alexander.
* Parker, Philip. 2005. Die Kreative Matrix. Konstanz: UVK.
