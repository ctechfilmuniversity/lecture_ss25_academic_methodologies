This approach to the colonial relationships between humans and plants from the perspective of dance and performance, which can enrich the perspective of the artistic approach in that "more-than-human" communication.

I think this article can be very interesting, since it is about a couple of authors that I`ve heard about feminism and the water as an element to rethink our relationship with the more than- human world from a dramaturgy approach (Mielle Chandler and Astrida Neimanis’s article ‘Water and Gestationality: What Flows Beneath Ethics’ )
