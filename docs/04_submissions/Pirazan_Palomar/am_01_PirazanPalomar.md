# Session 01 - Introduction
by: David Leonardo Piraz√°n Palomar

## Task 01.01 - Working With Literature
_**Have a look at possible tools and setups to organize your collected papers. Choose a setup and reflect on your choice.**_
I will use Zotero, since it was recommended to me by persons with previous experience writing papers. It is versatile, I can organize my sources and quote easily. 


# Your Paper
## Task 01.02 - Topic Brainstorming
_**Collect a wide range of potential topics and keywords for your paper.**_
* Universal landscapes
* interaction with non- human beings
* music with plants
* Post colonialist communication
* Ecofeminism and communication
* Generative arts and nature input. 
* Non human dramaturgy. 
* "Nature language as a future communication medium. 


## Task 01.03 - Topic Selection

_**From your brainstorming output select three topics that you want to consider for your paper. Further, think about them, e.g.**_

### **Topic 1: Universal landscapes**

* _**What specifically interests you within that topic?**_
  The possibility of an experience that can transmit the diversity of the different ways in which the human experience changes and put it together to coexist. 
  
* _**What further characteristics does the topic have?**_
  I find it fascinating that even beyond the cultural, idiomatic or political barriers, all humans have a general recognition of what a tree is, what a plant is, or the rain, or the soil, the sun, the moon. What if we could coexist one common landscape that could transmit us the way others perceive that spaces without speaking the same human language? 

* _**What questions could you ask about that topic?**_
    * What are the different perspectives of nature?
    * How could different perspectives coexists?
    * What to do with incompatible points of view?
    * How to coexist without colonizing others perspectives?

* _**How could you solve those questions?**_
  * Identifying different human experiences regarding the same ecosystems. 
  * Identify common points and problematic points. 
  * Design a cohesive landscape where there is a balance in the diversity. 

### **Topic 2: Non human dramaturgies and narratives.**

* _**What specifically interests you within that topic?**_
    The possibility of learning and co-writing stories with non human species like plants, trees, lakes, oceans, fungi. 

* _**What further characteristics does the topic have?**_
  The communication of these being is based on science and the dramaturgy and narrative are closer to a more creative or abstract approach.

* _**What questions could you ask about that topic?**_
  * Are there dramaturgies and narratives in nature?
  * Can we integrate those within our discourses?
  * Can we tell non human stories that are still appealing to the humans?
  * How can we give agency within the frame of the storytelling to the non human beings?
  
* _**How could you solve those questions?**_
    * Nature communication research. 
    * To read about eco feminist narratives and dramaturgies. 
    * Learn about non human narratives and the market possibilities. 
  
### **Topic 3: Music with plants**
* _**What specifically interests you within that topic?**_
    * The possibility of a creative relationship with the plants and to give them explicit agency. 

* _**What further characteristics does the topic have?**_
    * Normally plants are already being used as instruments and the humans are the translators, I wonder how to register the ways the plants speak to each other and instead of translating just amplifying that communication. 

* _**What questions could you ask about that topic?**_
    * Do plants play their own music?
    * Can we amplify what they do without stealing the spotlight?
    * Can we be part of the "conversation" they are having?
    
* _**How could you solve those questions?**_
  * Learn about how plants communicate
  * Learn how to amplify those communications
  * Identify how other persons have tried to interact with the plants and probably create new discourses.
