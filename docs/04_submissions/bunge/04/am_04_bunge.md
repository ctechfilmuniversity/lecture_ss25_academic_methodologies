Feedback Lena:
* The overall paper structure is still missing, which I highly recommend to work on at this point. You submission is still very vague.
* What means "understand" in 1.1 specifically? What do you write about? E.g. you compare their criteria and methodologies regarding what?
* 2. Have almost the same sub-section titles as the section title *might* read repetitive. I suggest to find a different section title.
* "text-based emotional intelligence" it a vague term. You probably need a section to introduce and explain it, ideally also with related work.
* Why the clustering? How are you planning on doing it and what follows from these clusters?
* What are your expected results / contributions?
