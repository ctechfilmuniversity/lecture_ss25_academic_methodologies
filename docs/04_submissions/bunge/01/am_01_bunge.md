## Session 01 - Introduction

### Task 01.01 - Working With Literature

I will be using Zotero to manage my references while writing the paper. It allows me to save sources, organize them into collections, and generate citations in different styles. Since I’ve used it before, I’m familiar with its features like note-taking and automatic bibliography creation.

## Your Paper

### Task 01.02 - Topic Brainstorming

Collect a wide range of potential topics and keywords for your paper.

Emotions in Chatbots: affective computing, emotion recognition, artificial empathy, conversational design, emotional manipulation, behavioural influence, artificial emotional intelligence,
Smart Textiles: wearable tech, biosensors, affective interfaces, data visualization, embodiment, behavioral feedback, AirTags,
AI in Politics: algorithmic bias, political discourse, misinformation, regulations, moderations.

### Task 01.03 - Topic Selection

**Emotion implementation in chatbots/avatars:**

- What specifically interests you within that topic?:
  - How emotional expression in chatbots or avatars influences user behavior, trust, and empathy.
  - Design choices behind emotional responses—what counts as “too much” or “too human”?
  - the difference between simulated emotions (e.g., via facial expressions or tone) and perceived authenticity.
  - How people emotionally attach to AI characters,
- What further characteristics does the topic have?
  - Multimodality: Emotions can be conveyed through text, voice, facial expressions, or body language.
  - Ethics: Risk of emotional manipulation
  - Personalization: Some systems adapt their emotional tone based on user data over time (chatgpt)
- What questions could you ask about that topic?
  - Do users trust emotionally responsive bots more than neutral ones?
  - Where is the line between emotional support and emotional manipulation?
  - What ethical frameworks should guide the creation of emotional AIs?
- How could you solve those questions?
  - Behavior Analysis, Interviews, or develope a guideline for responsible emotion implementation?

**AI in Politics:**

- What specifically interests you within that topic?
  - Bias and fairness

- What specifically interests you within that topic?
  - how clothes can respond to emotions or physiological states
  - Environmental sustainability—how smart textiles can contribute to reducing waste or improving energy efficiency.
  -
- What further characteristics does the topic have?
  - Data collection
  - Flexible electronics
- What questions could you ask about that topic?
- How could you solve those questions?
