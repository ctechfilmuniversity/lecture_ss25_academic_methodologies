## Session 01 - Introduction

### Task 01.01 - Working With Literature

I will be using **Zotero** to manage my references while writing the paper. It allows me to save sources, organize them into collections, and generate citations in different styles. Since I’ve used it before, I’m familiar with its features like note-taking and automatic bibliography creation.

## Your Paper

### Task 01.02 - Topic Brainstorming

Collect a wide range of potential topics and keywords for your paper.

Emotions in Chatbots: affective computing, emotion recognition, artificial empathy, conversational design, emotional manipulation, behavioural influence, artificial emotional intelligence,
Smart Textiles: wearable tech, biosensors, affective interfaces, data visualization, embodiment, behavioral feedback, AirTags,
AI in Politics: algorithmic bias, political discourse, misinformation, regulations, moderations.

### Task 01.03 - Topic Selection

**Emotion implementation in chatbots/avatars:**

- What specifically interests you within that topic?:
  - How emotional expression in chatbots or avatars influences user behavior, trust, and empathy.
  - Design choices behind emotional responses—what counts as “too much” or “too human”?
  - the difference between simulated emotions (e.g., via facial expressions or tone) and perceived authenticity.
  - How people emotionally attach to AI characters,
- What further characteristics does the topic have?
  - Multimodality: Emotions can be conveyed through text, voice, facial expressions, or body language.
  - Ethics: Risk of emotional manipulation
  - Personalization: Some systems adapt their emotional tone based on user data over time (chatgpt)
- What questions could you ask about that topic?
  - Do users trust emotionally responsive bots more than neutral ones?
  - Where is the line between emotional support and emotional manipulation?
  - What ethical frameworks should guide the creation of emotional AIs?
- How could you solve those questions?
  - Behavior Analysis, Interviews, or develope a guideline for responsible emotion implementation?

**Technology in Politics:**

- What specifically interests you within that topic?
  - Bias and fairness
  - Predictive Politics: getting or using (big) data and ML models to forecast election outcomes, public sentiment, or even policy/events impact
  - bias in political algoritms;
- What further characteristics does the topic have?
  - Technological colonialismn
  - Can technology make politics more inclusive?
- What questions could you ask about that topic?
  - How do machine learning algorithms shape political discourse online? is there a way to do it the other way around?
  -
- How could you solve those questions?
  - create a simulation
  - hmm

**Smart Textiles:**

- What specifically interests you within that topic?
  - how clothes can respond to emotions or physiological states
  - Environmental sustainability—how smart textiles can contribute to reducing waste or improving energy efficiency.
  -
- What further characteristics does the topic have?
  - Data collection
  - Flexible electronics
  - (interactive) Fashion?
- What questions could you ask about that topic?
  - What kind of HCI is happening in this case?
- How could you solve those questions?
  - Analyse user-eperience case studies
