## Research Question Thoughts:

#### First Thoughts:

A computer would emulate emotions through programmed behaviors, much like an actor portrays feelings on stage—not by experiencing them, but by skillfully reproducing their outward expressions.

#### Overall Topic:

Integrating Theatre and Acting Techniques:

- How can theatrical methods like improvisation or subtext work be used to generate more believable emotional expressions in robotic systems?
- How can theatrical methods like improvisation or subtext work be used to generate more believable emotional expressions in robotic systems?

#### First thought about the Research Question:

The Turing test for Affective Computing: What are the implications of machines simulating emotions? And how do we distinguish between simulation, representation, and „real“ feeling?
(Base rules for the creation of a framework or test)

#### Extracts and Summary from Academic papers:

''' Does the actress really have to experience the same
emotions her character is supposed to express? Or is a careful
imitation of the outward signs of emotion sufficient for
a believable simulation of human affect? What began as a
debate among professional actors in the eighteenth century has developed a rich body of knowledge about the simulation of human emotion on stage and screen. (…) to apply this knowledge
to the field of affective computing by asking what
mechanisms and tricks from the art of acting can help us
create the illusion of an emotional machine. (Manuel Flurin Hendry, 2023) '''

#### Brainstorm Pile:

does believability require authenticity - performance theory

- **Improvisation** – In acting, this is the spontaneous generation of behavior in response to a situation/context. In robotics, this could mean adaptive responses based on environmental cues or user emotions?
- **Subtext** – The underlying emotion or intention not spoken directly. Could robots express layered emotions or internal 'motivations' that are not explicitly stated?
- **Comparative Study**: Compare audience perceptions of emotion between robots using data-driven vs. theatre-inspired emotional models (do these exist..?)
- **Simulation**: How do actors simulate emotions which they haven’t felt before (depression, loss of a familiar)
