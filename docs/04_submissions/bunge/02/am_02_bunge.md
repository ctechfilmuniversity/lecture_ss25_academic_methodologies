# Research Question:

## 12.05.25:

_Research Question 1_<br>
**The Turing test for Affective Computing: How can theatrical method of subtext be used to generate more believable emotional expressions in robotic systems?**

_Context - theoretical application_<br>
In the direction on general perspective of acting methods (subtext). Investiganting diferent methods like Stanislavski or Chekhov’s for simulating. Apply a more theoretical approach to it.

---

_Research Question 2 - framework of test_<br>
**Towards an Emotional Turing Test: In what ways can the theatrical concept of subtext serve as a computational framework for modeling emotional states in artificial agents, for example GPTpersonas.**

_Context - framework of test_<br>
How can a Turing Test for Affective Computing be designed to evaluate the emotional believability of machines, and what are the implications of machines simulating emotions.

### First Thoughts:

A computer would emulate emotions through programmed behaviors, much like an actor portrays feelings on stage—not by experiencing them, but by skillfully reproducing their outward expressions.

#### Overall Topic:

Integrating Theatre and Acting Techniques:

- How can theatrical methods like improvisation or subtext work be used to generate more believable emotional expressions in robotic systems?
- How can theatrical methods like improvisation or subtext work be used to generate more believable emotional expressions in robotic systems?

#### First thought about the Research Question:

The Turing test for Affective Computing: What are the implications of machines simulating emotions? And how do we distinguish between simulation, representation, and „real“ feeling?
(Base rules for the creation of a framework or test)

#### Extracts and Summary from Academic papers:

''' Does the actress really have to experience the same
emotions her character is supposed to express? Or is a careful
imitation of the outward signs of emotion sufficient for
a believable simulation of human affect? What began as a
debate among professional actors in the eighteenth century has developed a rich body of knowledge about the simulation of human emotion on stage and screen. (…) to apply this knowledge
to the field of affective computing by asking what
mechanisms and tricks from the art of acting can help us
create the illusion of an emotional machine. (Manuel Flurin Hendry, 2023) '''

#### Stanislavski's Methode:

Every action has an objective (goal), but the emotion is driven by motivation and internal conflict.

- Surface Layer: What the character does or says (visible behavior).
- Inner Layer: What the character thinks or feels (invisible emotional truth).
- Superobjective: A larger desire that colors the entire performance
  -could also be describes as Intent vs. Expression: Intention (what it wants to achieve), Text (what is meant), subtext (what is really meant)

#### Michael Chekhov’s Method: Psychological Gesture

Actors use physical gestures to externalize inner emotion. These gestures carry subtext.

- Different gestures can contradict the line being spoken.
- Focuses on the actor’s inner impulse.
- could be described as a layered emotion: Surface emotion (what is shown), Internal Emotion (what is felt), contradiction (between the two)

#### Brainstorm Pile:

does believability require authenticity - performance theory

- **Improvisation** – In acting, this is the spontaneous generation of behavior in response to a situation/context. In robotics, this could mean adaptive responses based on environmental cues or user emotions?
- **Subtext** – The underlying emotion or intention not spoken directly. Could robots express layered emotions or internal 'motivations' that are not explicitly stated?
- **Comparative Study**: Compare audience perceptions of emotion between robots using data-driven vs. theatre-inspired emotional models (do these exist..?)
- **Simulation**: How do actors simulate emotions which they haven’t felt before (depression, loss of a familiar)
