# Research Introduction

## Research Question

Towards an Emotional Turing Test: How can a Turing Test for affective computing be designed to evaluate the emotional believability of machines, particularly in a text-based scenario?

## Introduction

The Turing Test, which proposes the possibility of distinguishing between a human and a machine based on their responses (Pizzi et al., 2025), serves as a foundational concept for this research. Understanding and predicting the emotions of others is a fundamental aspect of human social interaction (Cowan et al., 2023).
While the classic Turing Test evaluates cognitive believability, this paper turns its focus to emotional believability, by not just asking; can machines think like us? But, can they feel like us, or at least appear to?  
This paper aims to explore the foundations of a Turing Test designed to evaluate emotional intelligence in machines. Specifically, it explores what is needed to create a meaningful test scenario that determines the emotional believability of chatbots, focusing on text-based interactions with AI agents such as GPTpersonas.

In other words, what structure, criteria, or conditions must such a test have, to determine whether a machine is emotionally convincing through text alone?

For this, the research follows a dual approach: first, identifying the necessary components and criteria for designing an Turing Test. Here I will research and create some base rules for the Turing test, focusing on text-based tests only.
Secondly, defining categories that can be used to determine a chatbotâ€™s ability to simulate emotional intelligence, drawing from relevant research in affective computing, text-based emotion detection, and emotion recognition. The second part of the research will use a cluster method. Trying to come up with categories of what is needed to analyze the emotional intelligence of a chatbot.

## Use of AI

Inside the folder "AI" I have added screenshots of my used prompts and its responses for this particular task. _./04_submissions/bunge/03/AI_
