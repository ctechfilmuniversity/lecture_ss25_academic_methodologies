## Your Paper

### Task 03.02 - Final Description

ðŸš¨ Super hard, evil deadline: **May 23th, anytime on earth**! ðŸš¨

Describe in max. 1500 characters, what your paper investigates. Be specific, well-defined and narrow. If you have a research question: even better.
  
* This description must be continuous text and proper language.
* List all prompts that you have used with an AI tool to create the text, both regarding linguistic optimization and content investigation.

I first wrote the text on my own, then used the prompt below. I was mainly interested in a more refined logical structure. I edited the proposed version for my final text.

> __Prompt:__ I am writing a proposal for a research paper for my lecture, called Academic Methodologies. I want to write a survey for current state of the art in computational methods for birdsong analysis/ extraction of syllables. I have written it, but I would like help with proper logical transition between sentences and logical structure. Also, keep the language scientific and similar to my style. Do not use too complex or long, convoluted sentences.

__Rough topic formulation:__ Survey on state of the art computation methods for birdsong analysis, focusing on the automated extraction and annotation of syllables

Computational methods have been widely and successfully applied in various domains of audio and acoustics, such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, and music information retrieval.
However, in the field of computational bioacoustics, a subfield of bioacoustics concerned with the algorithmic analysis of animal vocalizations, their application is relatively recent.
This emerging area seeks to leverage technological advancements with the goal to address and automate tasks that have traditionally required significant expert knowledge and manual effort.

Birds are among the most extensively studied subjects in wildlife bioacoustics.
Analyzing bird vocalizations provides insights into behavioral patterns, biodiversity, environmental changes, and ecological health.
Songbirds, particularly, present a compelling area of study due to their capacity for imitative vocal learning.
Their vocalizations are shaped by both genetic predispositions and experiential learning, offering parallels to human speech acquisition and sensory-motor learning mechanisms.

Bird songs are typically segmented and annotated at the syllable level, where a syllable refers to a behavioral unit of within the birdsong.
This annotation process is labor-intensive, often requiring expert manual labeling.
Developing computational methods capable of reliably automating syllable segmentation and classification would significantly enhance the efficiency and scale of avian bioacoustic research.

Beyond ecological and biological research, the structural features of birdsong are also of interest to the field of creative technologies.
These structures can be explored as data sources for generative algorithms in audio-visual art.
Such applications not only provide novel aesthetic outputs but also serve to increase public engagement with scientific topics and highlight the ecological importance of birds.
In this way, creative practices may play a role in promoting awareness and supporting further research in wildlife bioacoustics and animal communication.

The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of the current state of the art in computational analysis of birdsong, with a particular focus on methods for syllable extraction and annotation.
The goal is to identify key approaches, evaluate their effectiveness, and outline the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in this growing interdisciplinary field.
