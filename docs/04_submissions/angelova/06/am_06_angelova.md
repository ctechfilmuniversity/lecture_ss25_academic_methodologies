## Your Paper

### Task 06.01 - Introduction


Write the introduction for your paper. You do not need to re-use this introduction later for your actual paper - but you should!

**Do not use a GenAi Tool for this task, as it is about practicing to write.**  
After all learning to write, is learning to think...

*Submission*: Your introduction - no need to use the paper template yet but you can make the submission with a markdown file.

### Introduction

Bird vocalizations offer a rich model for studying complex sequential behaviors, with parallels to human speech in its structured organization.
They can be divided into two main groups - calls and songs, with the songs being longer and more complex.
They are typically composed of discrete acoustic units, called syllables, which are separated by silence or amplitude changes, and arranged into motifs and song bouts, following complex species-specific rules [1].

Analyzing birdsong sheds light on the brain mechanisms of vocal behavior across species, offering a valuable comparative model for understanding human speech and language [2].
While it lacks semantic content, its hierarchical and rule-governed structure mirrors aspects of the human syntax, making birdsong well-suited to computational modelling and analysis.
These methods, given the complexity and scale of vocal datasets, as well as the limitations of manual annotations, can play an important role in advancing birdsong research, offering scalable and reproducible solutions to this complex task.

Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the current computational methods for birdsong analysis, focusing on the segmentation and classification tasks. In addition, we provide brief history of the task, discuss available datasets and evaluation metrics, identify common challenges, and highlight future directions.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we discuss previous related work.
In Section 3 we provide a brief overview of the functions and the structure of a birdsong. We discuss the most commonly studied song birds as well.
Section 4 presents common datasets and metrics, used for the task of computational birdsong analysis.
Furthermore, in Section 5 we present our classification of the computational methods for birdsong analysis, separating them in 3 main groups - the first one is based on the methodological paradigms, the second - on the data modalities, and the third - on the learning framework.
In the last Section 6 we conclude our survey paper and discuss open questions and tasks.
