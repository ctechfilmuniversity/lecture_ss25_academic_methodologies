## Literature
### Task 01.01 - Working With Literature

_Have a look at possible tools and setups to organize your collected papers. Chose a setup and reflect on your choice._

I haven’t used any tools so far because they don’t really fit into my workflow. However, I plan to look into some tools and try them out over the course of the semester.

My usual workflow is to keep one main folder for my research, with subfolders where I organize notes and collect papers. I usually store the papers as files in a "papers" folder and also link to them in my notes. Once I’ve started reading and have a sense of which papers are potentially useful or important, I like to print them out, since I prefer working with text on paper.

## Your Paper

### Task 01.02 - Topic Brainstorming

_Collect a wide range of potential topics and keywords for your paper._

My primary interest lies in exploring natural phenomena such as __birdsong__, __fungal networks__, or other ecological or biological patterns, as conceptual and structural inspiration for computational algorithms. The goal is to investigate how these naturally occurring systems can be translated into generative processes that result in either artistic outputs, functional systems, or ideally, both. The work bridges the fields of nature-inspired computing, algorithmic aesthetics, and data-driven visual representation.

Keywords and Topics:

- Nature-inspired algorithms
- Digital morphogenesis
- Audio feature extraction (MFCC, FFT, pitch, timbre)
- Procedural generation
- Fungal and mycorrhizal networks
- Generative art
- Creative coding
- Biomimicry in computation
- Computational aesthetics
- Data visualization with natural metaphors
- Organic growth modeling
- Algorithmic pattern recognition
- Ecological complexity in design
- Artificial life and emergent systems

### Task 01.03 - Topic Selection

_From your brainstorming output select three topics that you want to consider for your paper. Further, think about them, e.g._

* _What specifically interests you within that topic?_
* _What further characteristics does the topic have?_
* _What questions could you ask about that topic?_
* _How could you solve those questions?_

#### 1. Birdsong-Driven Algorithmic Morphogenesis

__Topic ideas:__

- Mapping birdsong features to generative visual systems
- Audio-driven digital morphogenesis
- Spectral and temporal analysis of birdsong for creative computation
- Bioacoustics as input modality for computational aesthetics

__Keywords__

birdsong analysis, audio feature extraction (mfcc, fft, spectral centroid), bioacousticsm pattern recognition in natural signals, algorithmic art, generative visuals, sonification / audio-visual mapping, spectrogram segmentation, creative machine learning

__Research description__

The topic should explore the use of birdsong — a biologically rich, structured audio source, as input for generative algorithms that produce visual or morphological outputs. By using established audio feature extraction methods (e.g., MFCCs, STFT, or TweetyNet models), the research aims to identify underlying patterns in birdsong and translate these into rules for algorithmic visuals.


#### 2. Mycorrhizal Networks as Models for Generative Algorithms
  
__Topic ideas:__

- Decentralized algorithm design inspired by fungal communication
- Rhizomatic network structures in algorithmic art
- Procedural growth systems based on mycorrhizal behavior
- Information propagation through fungal-inspired models

__Keywords:__

mycorrhizal networks, rhizome theory, decentralized systems, biomimetic algorithms, fungal computation, growth modeling, network topology, generative design, agent-based modeling, symbiosis and cooperation in natural systems

__Research description:__

The topic should investigate the communication strategies and structural behaviors of mycorrhizal fungi as inspiration for computational algorithms. These symbiotic networks offer a model of decentralized intelligence, efficient resource distribution, and emergent complexity. By abstracting these principles into computational growth algorithms or visual morphogenetic systems, the goal is to contributes to procedural modeling, visual art, etc.

#### 3. Nature-Inspired Data Visualization (general direction)
  
__Topic ideas:__

- Natural metaphors in the design of data visualization systems
- Using biological growth patterns to represent complex datasets
- Ecological aesthetics for representing systemic data
- Algorithmic ecosystems as visualization frameworks

__Keywords:__

data visualization, natural patterns, biomorphic interfaces, morphogenetic design, ecological metaphor, organic data mapping, growth-based visualization, bio-inspired interaction design, procedural aesthetics, information design

__Research description:__

This topic should explore how natural forms and systems such as branching structures, waveforms, or ecological networks, can inform the design of expressive, intuitive data visualizations. Instead of conventional bar and line charts, the focus is on biologically inspired representations that emphasize growth, adaptation, and interconnectedness. The result should be (some kind of) an approach to visualization that combines function and form, particularly suited for environmental data or systems modeling.
